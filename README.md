# human emotion classifier using classical machine learning methods &amp; face recognition
in this project i was about studying classical machine learning models by creating simple classifier between 7 human emotions (neutral, anger, contempt, disgust, fear, happiness, surprise). main goal of the algorithm is to predict the emotions on a person's face photograph using some labeled dataset. 
in this case i'm taking dataset containing human faces photographs where they were asked to show 7 emotions -> preparing it for machine learning methods (cropping, augmentation, histogram equalization) -> extracting gabor features -> applying PCA+LDA combo -> using some basic ml models (dt, rf, adaboost, gradient boosting, svm, knn and naive bayes)
